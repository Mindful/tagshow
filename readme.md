TagShow is a simple set of Python scripts intended primarily to help manage
downloading illustrations from various places (currentl Danbooru and Pixiv)
and compile them into slideshows. 


Dependencies
-- 

The requirements.txt file includes all of the Python dependencies, but
TagShow also requires [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and
[Galleria](https://galleria.io/) to be present in the `rendering_resources`
directory.
